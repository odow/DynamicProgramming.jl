    "text": "A SDP model is stored in the SDPModel type. A SDPModel can be intialised using the following SDPModel() do ... end block structure:m = SDPModel(\n        stages = 1.   # Int\n        sense  = :Min # Symbol (:Min or :Max)\n    ) do sp, t\n\n        ... problem definition ...\n\nendsp can be given any name but refers to the stage problem. t can also be given any name, but refers to an index that runs from 1 to T where T is the number of stages.Inside the SDPModel definition, we define our subproblems. We first need to add some state variables, some control (or action) variables, and some noise (or stochastic) variables."

    "text": "States can be added with the following macro:@addstates!(sp, begin\n    x = linspace(0, 1, 10)\nend)This creates a state variable x that is discretised into the set linspace(0, 1, 10). Note that currently, all state dimensions get converted into Float64 representations. The discretisation should be any type that can be converted to a Vector{Float64} type.Controls can be added with the @addcontrols! macro that has similar syntax. However there is less restriction on the type. The discretisation should just be an iterable subtype of AbstractVector.Noise (or stochastic variables) can be added with the @addnoises! macro:@addnoises!(sp, begin\n    u = DiscreteDistribution([1,2,3], [0.5, 0.25, 0.25])\n    v = 1:10\nend)In contrast to the other two macros, there is a slight subtlety. The discretisations can either be subtypes of AbstractVector (in which case their realisations are assumed to be uniformly sampled), or a DiscreteDistribution.The WeighedDist constructor is DiscreteDistribution(values::AbstractVector, probability::AbstractVector). This realisations values are sampled with probability probability.If more than one noise is defined, then the multiple noises are assumed to be independent."

    "text": "You must provide a function that takes four inputs.function foo(states_out, states, controls, noises)\nendHowever, we prefer the anonymous function syntax:dynamics!(sp, (y, x, u, w) -> (\n        ... definitions ...\n    )\n)This anonymous function must take the current state x,  a control u and a noise w and update the new state y.You can refer to model variables using the [] indexing operator. For example, if we defined a state variable quantity, we could refer it as x[quantity].By thinking about variable scopes it is possible to encapsulate all the necessary data into this syntax."
