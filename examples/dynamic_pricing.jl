#  Dynamic pricing with customer choice model (MNL)
#   
#  An enterprise needs to determine the price for its inventory, composed of 
#  n substitutable products. There are three main factors that affect an user
#  choice: current inventory x, quality a and price r. The utility for a 
#  product is given by Uᵢ = (aᵢ-rᵢ) + eᵢ, where eᵢ is an independent 
#  identically distributed Gumbel random variables having μ as scale 
#  parameter. The utility of no-buy is given by u₀. Customers arrivals follow
#  a non-homogeneous Poisson process with intensity λ. The probability that a 
#  customer buy product i, with vector of price r, is modelled with a MNL
#  model, and it's denoted by P(r, i). Given the initial inventory, the 
#  enterprise needs to find the best policy to maximize the expected profit 
#  for each period t ∈ T.
#
#  πₜ(x) = max rₜ∈ℝⁿ {λ ∑i∈S(x) P(rₜ, i)[rₜ(i) Δπ(t, i, x)] + πₜ₋₁(x) }
#  where Δπ = πₜ₋₁(x) - πₜ₋₁(x-eⁱ), eⁱ is the unit vector with 1 in
#  position i and S(x) returns the non zero inventory items.
#
#  To run with N processors, use
#      julia -p N dynamic_pricing.jl
